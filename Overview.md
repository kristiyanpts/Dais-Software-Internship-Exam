# Exam Overview

### I. Things that I wanted to do, but one work day isn’t enough:

- As we know, the current implementation of the project doesn’t support creating new bank accounts. I wanted to make so that a user could fill in a form for a bank account opening request, which could then be reviewed by the banking system employees and either get accepted and the bank account is created, or get rejected and its not created. This is rather easy to do, but its time consuming, as I would have to make RBAC control, so that the users would have different roles and different access levels. Then I would have to make an admin panel where these requests can be managed by the users that have access. That would take more than the time we had today, so I did not implement it.
- Another cool thing to have would be a statement export for a given bank account, so you could export all of your account movement into a document like excel or some other kind, but this is advanced and its worth it to implement that kind of stuff if the project would actually be used in a production environment :D
